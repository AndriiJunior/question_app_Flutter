# question_app

It's a quiz app, I use API & json to show questions for user and check if it true or falseand. There I use custom fonts.
App opens in the same way on both platform(IOS and Android)!


First Page.

On main page you can see logo, difficulty level, difficulty level slider(only 3 opportunity, easy, medium, hard), and start button.
